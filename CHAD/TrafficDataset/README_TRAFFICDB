-- NOTES --
This a database of video of traffic on the highway used in [1] and [2].  The 
video was taken over two days from a stationary camera overlooking I-5 in 
Seattle, WA.  The video were labeled manually as light, medium, and heavy 
traffic, which correspond respectively to free-flowing traffic, traffic at 
reduced speed, and stopped or very slow speed traffic.  The training and test
sets used in [1] and [2] are also provided.  The first frame of the original
video is corrupted with another video signal, so when processing each video 
you will have to start from the 2nd frame.  In addition, the cropped versions
of the video used in [1,2] are provided in a MATLAB file.  The video is 
provided courtesy of Washington State Department of Transportation 
[http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/].  Please reference [1] if you use this database.
